**LoggiFly** - A Lightweight Tool that monitors Docker Container Logs for predefined keywords or regex patterns and sends Notifications.

Get instant alerts for security breaches, system errors, or custom patterns through your favorite notification channels. üöÄ


**Ideal For**:
- ‚úÖ Catching security breaches (e.g., failed logins in Vaultwarden)
- ‚úÖ Debugging crashes with attached log context
- ‚úÖ Restarting containers on specific errors or stopping them completely to avoid restart loops
- ‚úÖ Monitoring custom app behaviors (e.g., when a user downloads an audiobook on your Audiobookshelf server)

>[!TIP]
For better security use a [Docker Socket Proxy](#%EF%B8%8F-socket-proxy). You won't be able to trigger container stops/restarts with a proxy, but if you don't need that and want to secure your setup I recommend you take a look at [this section](#%EF%B8%8F-socket-proxy) before you finish the Quick Start Install process and think about using that compose file instead of the basic one in the Quick Start.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start


In this quickstart only the most essential settings are covered, [here](#-Configuration-Deep-Dive) is a more detailed config walkthrough.<br>

Choose your preferred setup method - simple environment variables for basic use or a YAML config for advanced control.
- Environment variables allow for a simple and much quicker setup
- With YAML you can use complex Regex patterns, have different keywords & other settings per container and set keywords that trigger a restart/stop of the container.

> [!Note]
In previous versions the default location for the `config.yaml` file was `/app/config.yaml`. The old path still works (so not a breaking change) but the new official path is now `/config/config.yaml`.<br>
LoggiFly will first look in `/config/config.yaml`, and fall back to `/app/config.yaml` if it's not found.<br>
When `/config` is mounted a config template will be downloaded into that directory. 

<details><summary><em>Click to expand:</em> üêã <strong>Basic Setup: Docker Compose (Environment Variables)</strong></summary>
Ideal for quick setup with minimal configuration

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  loggifly:
    image: ghcr.io/clemcer/loggifly:latest
    container_name: loggifly
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      # This is where you would put your config.yaml file (ignore if you are only using environment variables)
      # - ./loggifly/config:/config  
    environment:
      # Choose at least one notification service
      NTFY_URL: "https://ntfy.sh"       
      NTFY_TOPIC: "your_topic"          
      # Token or Username+Password In case you need authentication
      # NTFY_TOKEN:
      # NTFY_USERNAME:
      # NTFY_PASSWORD:
      APPRISE_URL: "discord://..."      # Apprise-compatible URL
    
      CONTAINERS: "vaultwarden,audiobookshelf"        # Comma-separated list
      GLOBAL_KEYWORDS: "error,failed login,password"  # Basic keyword monitoring
      GLOBAL_KEYWORDS_WITH_ATTACHMENT: "critical"     # Attaches a log file to the notification
    restart: unless-stopped 
```
</details>


<details><summary><em>Click to expand:</em><strong> üìú Advanced Setup: YAML Configuration</strong></summary>

Recommended for granular control, regex patterns and action_keywords. <br>

**Step 1: Docker Compose**

Use this [docker compose](/docker-compose.yaml) and edit this line:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./loggifly/config:/config  # üëà Replace left side of the mapping with your local path
```
If you want you can configure some of the settings or sensitive values like ntfy tokens or apprise URLs via [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables).

**Step 2: Configure Your config.yaml**

If `/config` is mounted a [template file](/config_template.yaml) will be downloaded into that directory. You can edit the downloaded template file and rename it to `config.yaml` to use it.<br>
You can also take a look at the [Configuration-Deep-Dive](#-Configuration-Deep-Dive) for all the configuration options.<br>
Or you can edit and copy paste the following minimal config into a newly created `config.yaml` file in `/config`.
```yaml
# You have to configure at least one container.
containers:
  container-name:  # Exact container name
  # Configure at least one type of keywords or use global keywords
    keywords:
      - error
      - regex: (username|password).*incorrect  # Use regex patterns when you need them
    # Attach a log file to the notification 
    keywords_with_attachment:
      - warn
    # Caution advised! These keywords will trigger a restart/stop of the container
    action_keywords:
      - stop: traceback
      - restart: critical

# Optional. These keywords are being monitored for all configured containers. There is an action_cooldown (see config deep dive)
global_keywords:
  keywords:
    - failed
  keywords_with_attachment:
    - critical

notifications:     
  # Configure either Ntfy or Apprise or both
  ntfy:
    url: http://your-ntfy-server  
    topic: loggifly                   
    token: ntfy-token               # Ntfy token in case you need authentication 
    username: john                  # Ntfy Username+Password in case you need authentication 
    password: 1234                  # Ntfy Username+Password in case you need authentication 
  apprise:
    url: "discord://webhook-url"    # Any Apprise-compatible URL (https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki)
```
</details><br>


**When everything is configured start the container**


```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## ü§ø Configuration Deep Dive


The Quick Start only covered the essential settings, here is a more detailed walktrough of all the configuration options.


### üìÅ Basic Structure

The `config.yaml` file is divided into four main sections:

1. **`settings`**: Global settings like cooldowns and log levels. (_Optional since they all have default values_)
2. **`notifications`**: Configure Ntfy (_URL, Topic, Token, Priority and Tags_) and/or your Apprise URL
3. **`containers`**: Define which Containers to monitor and their specific Keywords (_plus optional settings_).
4. **`global_keywords`**: Keywords that apply to _all_ monitored Containers.


> [!IMPORTANT]
For the program to function you need to configure:
>- at least one container
>- at least one notification service (Ntfy or Apprise)
>- at least one keyword (either set globally or per container)
>
>  The rest is optional or has default values.


### üîé Detailed Configuration Options 

<details><summary><em>Click to expand:</em><strong> ‚öôÔ∏è Settings </strong></summary>

  notification_cooldown: 5      # Seconds between alerts for same keyword (per container)
  action_cooldown: 300          # Cooldown period (in seconds) before the next container action can be performed. Maximum is always at least 60s.
  attachment_lines: 20          # Number of Lines to include in log attachments
  multi_line_entries: True      # Monitor and catch multi-line log entries instead of going line by line. 
  reload_config: True        # When the config file is changed the program reloads the config
  disable_start_message: False  # Suppress startup notification
  disable_shutdown_message: False  # Suppress shutdown notification

[Here](/config_template.yaml) you can find a config template with all available configuration options and explaining comments. When `/config` is mounted in the volumes section of your docker compose this template file will be downloaded. <br>
[Here](/config_example.yaml) you can find an example config with some use cases.


### üçÄ Environment Variables

Except for `restart_keywords`, container specific settings/keywords and regex patterns you can configure most settings via docker environment variables.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Socket Proxy

A Docker Socket Proxy adds a security layer by controlling access to the Docker daemon ‚Äî essentially letting LoggiFly only read container info and logs without giving it full control over the docker socket.<br>
With the linuxserver Image I have had some connection and timeout problems while streaming logs so the recommended proxy is [Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy).<br>
When using the Tecnativa Proxy the log stream connection drops every ~10 minutes for whatever reason, LoggiFly simply resets the connection.<br>
Here is a sample docker-compose file:


<details><summary><em>Click to expand:</em> <strong>Socket Proxy: Docker Compose </strong></summary>

```yaml
services:
  loggifly:
    image: ghcr.io/clemcer/loggifly:latest
    container_name: loggifly 
    volumes:
      - .loggifly/config:/config # Place your config.yaml here
    environment:
      TZ: Europe/Berlin
      DOCKER_HOST: tcp://socket-proxy:2375
    depends_on:
      - socket-proxy
    restart: unless-stopped
    
  socket-proxy:
    image: tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy
    container_name: docker-socket-proxy
    environment:
      - CONTAINERS=1  
      - POST=0        
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro  
    restart: unless-stopped

```

</details>

<br>

>[!Note]
`action_keywords` don't work when using a socket proxy.

## üí° Tips

1. Ensure containers names **exactly match** your Docker **container names**. 
    - Find out your containers names: ```docker ps --format "{{.Names}}" ```
    - üí° Pro Tip: Define the `container_name:` in your compose files.
2. **`action_keywords`** can not be set via environment variables, they can only be set per container in the `config.yaml`. The `action_cooldown` is always at least 60s long and defaults to 300s
3. **Test Regex Patterns**: Validate patterns at [regex101.com](https://regex101.com) before adding them to your config.
4. **Troubleshooting Multi-Line Log Entries**. If LoggiFly only catches single lines from log entries that span over multiple lines:
    - Wait for Patterns: LoggiFly needs to process a few lines in order to detect the pattern the log entries start with (e.g. timestamps/log level)
    - Unrecognized Patterns: If issues persist, open an issue and share the affected log samples
