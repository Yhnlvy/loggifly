**LoggiFly** - A Lightweight Tool that monitors Docker Container Logs for predefined keywords or regex patterns and sends Notifications.

Get instant alerts for security breaches, system errors, or custom patterns through your favorite notification channels. üöÄ


**Ideal For**:
- ‚úÖ Catching security breaches (e.g., failed logins in Vaultwarden)
- ‚úÖ Debugging crashes with attached log context
- ‚úÖ Restarting containers on specific errors or stopping them completely to avoid restart loops
- ‚úÖ Monitoring custom app behaviors (e.g., when a user downloads an audiobook on your Audiobookshelf server)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start


In this quickstart only the most essential settings are covered, [here](#-Configuration-Deep-Dive) is a more detailed config walkthrough.<br>

Choose your preferred setup method - simple environment variables for basic use, or a YAML config for advanced control.
- Environment variables allow for a simple setup and let you spin this thing up in a minute
- With YAML you can use complex Regex patterns, have different keywords & other settings per container and set keywords that trigger a restart/stop of the container.

<details><summary><em>Click to expand:</em> üêã <strong>Basic Setup: Docker Compose (Environment Variables)</strong></summary>
Ideal for quick setup with minimal configuration

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  loggifly:
    image: ghcr.io/clemcer/loggifly:latest
    container_name: loggifly
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
#      - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml  # Path to your config file (ignore if you are only using environment variables)
    environment:
      # Choose at least one notification service
      NTFY_URL: "https://ntfy.sh"       # or your self-hosted instance
      NTFY_TOPIC: "your_topic"          # e.g., "docker_alerts"
      # Token or Username+Password In case you need authentication
      # NTFY_TOKEN:
      # NTFY_USERNAME:
      # NTFY_PASSWORD:
      APPRISE_URL: "discord://..."      # Apprise-compatible URL
    
      CONTAINERS: "vaultwarden,audiobookshelf"        # Comma-separated list
      GLOBAL_KEYWORDS: "error,failed login,password"  # Basic keyword monitoring
      GLOBAL_KEYWORDS_WITH_ATTACHMENT: "critical"     # Attaches a log file to the notification
    restart: unless-stopped 
```
</details>


<details><summary><em>Click to expand:</em><strong> üìú Advanced Setup: YAML Configuration</strong></summary>

Recommended for granular control and regex patterns. <br>

**Step 1: Update Docker Compose**

Uncomment/add this line in your docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./YOUR/CONFIG/FOLDER/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml  # üëà Replace left side of the mapping with your local path
```
**Step 2: Create Config File**

Create the config.yaml in your chosen folder:
```bash
mkdir -p ./loggifly_config  # Example folder
cd ./loggifly_config
touch config.yaml           # Create empty file
```
**Step 3: Configure Your config.yaml**

Add this minimal example config to the file you just created and edit it according to your needs.<br>(If you want more options take a look at the more detailed [config walkthrough](#-Configuration-Deep-Dive) or at this [example config](/config.yaml)):
```yaml
# You have to configure at least one container.
containers:
  container-name:  # Exact container name
  # Configure at least one type of keywords or use global keywords
    keywords:
      - error
      - regex: (username|password).*incorrect  # Use regex patterns when you need them
    # Attach a log file to the notification 
    keywords_with_attachment:
      - warn
    # Caution advised! These keywords will trigger a restart/stop of the container
    action_keywords:
      - stop: traceback
      - restart: critical

# Optional. These keywords are being monitored for all configured containers. There is an action_cooldown (see config deep dive)
global_keywords:
  keywords:
    - failed
  keywords_with_attachment:
    - critical

notifications:     
  # Configure either Ntfy or Apprise or both
  ntfy:
    url: http://your-ntfy-server  
    topic: loggifly                   
    token: ntfy-token               # Ntfy token in case you need authentication 
    username: john                  # Ntfy Username+Password in case you need authentication 
    password: 1234                  # Ntfy Username+Password in case you need authentication 
  apprise:
    url: "discord://webhook-url"    # Any Apprise-compatible URL (https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki)
```
</details><br>


**When everything is configured start the container**


```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## ü§ø Configuration Deep Dive


The Quick Start only covered the essential settings, here is a more detailed walktrough of all the configuration options.


### üìÅ Basic Structure

The **`config.yaml`** file is divided into four main sections:

1. **`settings`**: Global settings like cooldowns and log levels. (_Optional since they all have default values_)
2. **`notifications`**: Configure Ntfy (_URL, Topic, Token, Priority and Tags_) and/or your Apprise URL
3. **`containers`**: Define which Containers to monitor and their specific Keywords (_plus optional settings_).
4. **`global_keywords`**: Keywords that apply to _all_ monitored Containers.

<details><summary><em>Click to expand:</em><strong> ‚öôÔ∏è Settings </strong></summary>

```yaml
# These are the default settings
settings:          
  log_level: INFO               # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  notification_cooldown: 5      # Seconds between alerts for same keyword (per container)
  action_cooldown: 300          # Cooldown period (in seconds) before the next container action can be performed. Maximum is always at least 60s.
  attachment_lines: 20          # Number of Lines to include in log attachments
  multi_line_entries: True      # Monitor and catch multi-line log entries instead of going line by line. 
  reload_config: True        # When the config file is changed the program reloads the config
  disable_start_message: False  # Suppress startup notification
  disable_shutdown_message: False  # Suppress shutdown notification
  disable_config_reload_message: False   # Suppress config reload notification
```

</details>



<details><summary><em>Click to expand:</em><strong> üì≠ notifications </strong></summary>

```yaml
notifications:                       
  # At least one of the two (Ntfy/Apprise) is required.
  ntfy:
    url: http://your-ntfy-server    # Required. The URL of your Ntfy instance
    topic: loggifly.                # Required. the topic for Ntfy
    token: ntfy-token               # Ntfy token in case you need authentication 
    username: john                  # Ntfy Username+Password in case you need authentication 
    password: 1234                  # Ntfy Username+Password in case you need authentication 
    priority: 3                     # Ntfy priority (1-5)
    tags: kite,mag                  # Ntfy tags/emojis 
  apprise:
    url: "discord://webhook-url"    # Any Apprise-compatible URL (https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki)
```
</details>


<details><summary><em>Click to expand:</em><strong> üê≥ containers </strong></summary>

```yaml
containers:
  container-name:     # Must match exact container_name
    # The next 5 settings are optional. They override the respective global setting for this container 
    ntfy_topic: your_topic
    ntfy_tags: "tag1, tag2"     
    ntfy_priority: 4            
    attachment_lines: 10        
    notification_cooldown: 10   
    # Configure at least one type of keywords or use global keywords
    keywords:                                 
      - error                                  # Simple text matches
      - regex: (username|password).*incorrect  # Use regex patterns when you need them
    # When one of these keywords is found a logfile is attached to the notification
    keywords_with_attachment:
      - critical

    # action_keywords will trigger a restart/stop of the container and can only be set per container
    action_keywords:    # restart & stop are the only supported actions and have to be specified before every keyword
      - stop: traceback
      - restart:
          regex: critical.*failed # this is how to set regex patterns for action_keywords
    action_cooldown: 300 # 300s is the default time that has to pass until the next action can be triggered (minimum value is always 60)

# If you have configured global_keywords and don't need container specific settings you can define the container name and leave the rest blank
  another-container-name:
```

 </details>


<details><summary><em>Click to expand:</em><strong> üåç global_keywords </strong></summary>

```yaml
# This section is optional.
# These keywords are being monitored for all containers. 
global_keywords:              
  keywords:
    - error
  keywords_with_attachment:  # When one of these keywords is found a logfile is attached
    - regex: (critical|error)
```

</details>

[Here](/config.yaml) you can find a full example config.


### üçÄ Environment Variables

Except for `restart_keywords`, container specific settings and regex patterns you can configure most settings via docker environment variables.

## üí° Tips

1. Ensure containers names **exactly match** your Docker **container names**. 
    - Find out your containers names: ```docker ps --format "{{.Names}}" ```
    - üí° Pro Tip: Define the `container_name:` in your compose files.
2. **`action_keywords`** can not be set globally and only in the config.yaml. `action_cooldown` is always at least 60s and defaults to 300s
3. **Test Regex Patterns**: Validate patterns at [regex101.com](https://regex101.com) before adding them to your config.
4. When using a **Docker Socket Proxy** the log stream connection drops every ~10 minutes for whatever reason. LoggiFly simply resets the connection. This works but using a proxy is not officially recommended yet until I am sure everything works flawlessly. If you notice any bugs let me know!
5. **Troubleshooting Multi-Line Log Entries**. If LoggiFly only catches single lines from log entries that span over multiple lines:
    - Wait for Patterns: LoggiFly needs to process a few lines in order to detect the pattern the log entries start with (e.g. timestamps/log level)
    - Unrecognized Patterns: If issues persist, open an issue and share the affected log samples
