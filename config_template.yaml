#   - at least one container
#   - at least one notification service (Ntfy or Apprise)
#   - at least one keyword (either set globally or per container)
# The rest is optional or has default values.
#
# If you want to use this file after editing it make sure to rename it to config.yaml
#
# With every container exaample you can see some more available configuration options
