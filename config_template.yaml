#######    CONFIG TEMPLATE     #######
#
# This is a template for the config.yaml file.
# You can edit this file and remove all the parts you don't need.
# For the program to function you need to configure:
#   - at least one container
#   - at least one notification service (Ntfy or Apprise)
#   - at least one keyword (either set globally or per container)
# The rest is optional or has default values.
#
# If you want to use this file after editing it make sure to rename it to config.yaml
#
# With every container exaample you can see some more available configuration options
#
# I did not include the option to customize notifications in this template but:
#   - Here is a detailed explanation on that: https://github.com/clemcer/loggifly/main#-customize-notifications-templates--log-filtering
#   - And here are some examples: https://github.com/clemcer/loggifly/blob/main/config_example.yaml
